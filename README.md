# S2IP-LLM
Official reponsitory for "S^2IP-LLM: Semantic Space Informed Prompt Learning with LLM for Time Series Forecasting"




## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies by first building environment:

```
conda create -n "myenv" python=3.10.0
conda activate myenv
```
Inside the folder, run:
```
